# If you get hits for IUCP or chemical names, consider these automatic candidates for manual review
# the funky formatting of the words makes it really difficult to find reliable matches against these pictures.

# empty lines are ignored, and lines starting with # or / are ignored. so use those to keep some organization if you want
# the comment format I'm using is "/" for categories and "#" for information, like some of the IUPAC keywords being truncated to make the search slightly easier.
# but feel free to format in whatever way makes sense to you.

# the keywords arent case sensitive, so you dont need to do all caps like i did.

# I also left the "Test Phrases" that i used for the test images found in /images, like image_bad.png. Remember to delete this category from this file, and those test images
# from /images before running your analysis.
